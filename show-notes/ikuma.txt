Ikuma presents Earthquake DJ Mix!


The most earthshattering, bass rumbling, beat-matched chiptune mix to hit the face of our planet!

Featuring a multitude of chips (even an OPM schranz track) and artists from all over the scene including Rabato, USK, x|k, Covox, Factor 6, Flanboy and others. 

This mix is bound to pump you up and get your booty shaking.

Good preparation if you're going for the massive BLiP festival. (I can't attend, so i made this mix instead)
 
So stop stalling and start listening! Thank me later!!!
