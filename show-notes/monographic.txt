Monographic Podcast: Pterodactyl Squad


Pterodactyl Squad will soon feature as part of Inq's Monographic Podcast (www.inq-mag.com/monographic-podcast), a showcase for various netlabels.  And while much of this music has been played on the Gamewave Podcast before, we thought we'd release the episode in our feed too.  All the tracks come from current or future Pterodactyl Squad releases - www.ptesquad.com.
